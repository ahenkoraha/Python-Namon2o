    "3. **Floats**: Decimal numbers, used for prices or measurements that require precision.\n",

    "2. **Division**: Splitting a quantity into equal parts.\n",
    "   - Example: `half_price = price / 2` (This calculates half the price of an item)\n",
    "3. **Multiplication**: Repeating a quantity.\n",
    "   - Example: `total_cost = price * quantity` (This calculates the total cost of multiple items)\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Note**: You can also multiply strings, which repeats the string.\n",
    "   - Example: `repeated_name = \"Kwabena\" * 3` (This repeats the string \"Kwabena\" three times)\n",
    "4. **Subtraction**: Finding the difference between two numbers.\n",
