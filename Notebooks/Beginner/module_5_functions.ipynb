    "#### 👋 Welcome to Python Namon2o!\n",
    "> A beginner-friendly Python tutorial with examples grounded in Ghanaian/African culture. \n",
    "In this module, you'll learn about functions - reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks, just like recipes in the kitchen.\n",
    "We'll explore this through a familiar and flavourful lens: preparing a delicious Ghanaian dish like jollof rice or groundnut soup.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎯 Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this module, you will:\n",
    "- Understand what a function is and why it's useful \n",
    "- Learn about built-in functions in Python\n",
    "- Learn how to define and call your own functions\n",
    "- Practice using parameters and return values in functions\n",
    "- Understand how functions affect the flow of code execution\n",
    "- Apply functions to automate repetitive tasks in cooking\n",

    ">A function is a named block of code that performs a specific task. It allows you to group related code together, making it reusable and easier to manage. You define it once and can reuse it anywhere and as many times as needed in your code. Functions help break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces, just like following a recipe in the kitchen. It reduces repetition and makes your code cleaner, more organized, and easier to read."

    "#### 🧾 Everyday Analogy:\n",
    "Think of a function like a recipe in the kitchen. When you want to make jollof rice, waakye or groundnut soup, you follow a specific set of steps (the recipe) like \"boil rice\" or \"blend tomatoes\" to achieve the final dish. You can use the same recipe multiple times without rewriting it each time. Similarly, in programming, a function allows you to define a set of instructions once and use it whenever needed."
