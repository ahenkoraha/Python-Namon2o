    ">Loops allow you to repeat a block of code multiple times without having to write it out again and again. This is useful for tasks that require repetition, like counting, iterating through lists, or performing actions until a condition is met. There are two main types of loops in Python: `for` loops and `while` loops.\n",

    "#### 📘 About `range()`:\n",
    "> The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers. It is commonly used with `for` loops to specify how many times the loop should run. For example, `range(5)` generates the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, which can be used to repeat an action 5 times. It starts at 0 and ends just before 5. You can also specify a start and stop value, like `range(2, 6)`, which generates 2, 3, 4, and 5. Finally, you can add a step value, like `range(0, 10, 2)`, which generates 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8.\n",
